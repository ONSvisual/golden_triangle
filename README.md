# Golden Triangle

The ['Golden Triangle'](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/warehouses-next-day-delivery) is an area in the East Midlands that has a high density of warehouses and distribution facilities because it provides access to over 90% of the UK population within a 4 hours drive. There is no definitive boundary but the 'Golden Triangle' seems to stretch between Nottingham, Kidderminster and Biggleswade.
